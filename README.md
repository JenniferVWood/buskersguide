Buskers' Guide To The Universe

This is a guide for buskers ("street performers") and those who would like to listen to them.

It is basically a database of locations, rated by performers and audience, with comments and details.
For buskers, it may also include info on local ordinances and/or local customs.  For instance, in France, if you've got
more than about $20US in your hat, that's all you're going to get (but it's fine to put some of that in your pocket and
keep playing).  And, in Northampton MA (US), you need a $5 license from city hall to play.

Todo:

(feature)
Stub out details page


(bug)
improve de-duplication alg
prevent no-name locations

(infrastructure)
Set up DB connection so it will work with OpsWorks (JNDI?)
use real spring-security instead of the fakey thing I wrote (even if we still don't require passwords)
