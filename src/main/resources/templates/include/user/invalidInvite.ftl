<p>Sorry, it looks like you're trying to use an invite that isn't valid.</p>
<p>We get it, this whole invite-only signup is kind of a pain, but during this early-beta phase (translation:
I'm still building this thing, and haven't had time to put up wallpaper), it seems useful to allow for a slower ramp-up.</p>
<p>If you're still stuck, send an email to the address above and I'll get you set up.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
